<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Self Care Center is an application with a little bit of sass. Do you ever need someone to remind you you're a badass? Then this is the app for you! A user can choose between an affirmation or a mantra and will receive a random sassy message on button click. If a user likes a message they can favorite it and it will appear on their favorites page. A user can also review their favorites and remove them if they decide that message is just too sassy for them.

This was a solo project to gain experience building an application from scratch that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript and to better understand how to listen to and respond to user events.

The project specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html)

<!-- REFLECTIONS -->

## Reflections

This project was my first adventure into writing HTML and CSS, along with continuing to grow my JavaScript skills. I loved getting the chance to be creative and play with the aesthetics of an application while also making an app functional.

### Wins:
- Allowing myself to have fun and be creative while also utilizing my problem solving skills.

### Challenges:
- Getting overly excited and hyper-focused on styling, that functionality was not my top priority (a great lesson for all future projects!).
